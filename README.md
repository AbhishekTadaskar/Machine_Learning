## üîé Sub-Branches Explained

### 1. Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learning from labeled data (input ‚Üí output).  
- **Subtypes**:  
  - **Regression** ‚Üí Predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices, temperature).  
  - **Classification** ‚Üí Predicts categories (e.g., spam vs. not spam, disease detection).  
- **Examples**: Predicting stock prices, image recognition.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learning from unlabeled data by finding hidden patterns.  
- **Subtypes**:  
  - **Clustering** ‚Üí Groups similar items (e.g., customer segmentation).  
  - **Association** ‚Üí Finds relationships (e.g., ‚Äúusers who buy X also buy Y‚Äù).  
- **Examples**: Market basket analysis, grouping documents.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- **Definition**: Learning by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.  
- **Concepts**: Agent, Environment, Reward, Action, Policy.  
- **Subtypes**:  
  - **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** ‚Üí Framework for sequential decision-making.  
  - **Policy Optimization** ‚Üí Improves decision-making strategies over time.  
- **Examples**: Self-driving cars, robotics, game-playing AI (Chess, Go).

### 4. Deep Learning
- **Definition**: A specialized subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers.  
- **Subtypes**:  
  - **Neural Networks (ANNs)** ‚Üí General models for various tasks.  
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** ‚Üí Best for images and computer vision.  
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** ‚Üí Best for sequences (text, speech, time-series).  
- **Examples**: Face recognition, language translation, chatbots.
