## 🤖 Machine Learning Flowchart & Sub-Branches
## 🌐 What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.
## 🏗️ ML Flowchart Overview

Below is a flowchart that shows the main branches of Machine Learning and their key categories:

## 🔎 Sub-Branches Explained
### 1. Supervised Learning

Definition: Learning from labeled data (input → output).

Subtypes:

Regression → Predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices, temperature).

Classification → Predicts categories (e.g., spam vs. not spam, disease detection).

Examples: Predicting stock prices, image recognition.
